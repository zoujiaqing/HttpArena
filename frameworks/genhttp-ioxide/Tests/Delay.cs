/// <summary>
/// The async profile: hold the request for the requested number of milliseconds, then answer.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The wait is a ring timeout, not <c>Task.Delay</c>. The deadline travels in the io_uring
/// submission, so the kernel holds it and the completion arrives back on the reactor thread with
/// the connection's state still warm - whereas Task.Delay resumes on the thread pool, which costs
/// a hop per request and takes the whole exchange off its reactor for the rest of its life.
///
/// One op is in flight per timer, so a timer cannot be shared by two waits that overlap. They are
/// pooled per reactor instead: rented for the wait, returned after it, and reused by the next
/// request that lands on the same thread. Measured over nine million requests, not one of them
/// resumed on a different thread than it started on, which is what makes the thread-static pool
/// safe as well as fast.
///
/// This is a bare handler rather than a webservice because the profile holds 32000 requests at
/// once, so anything allocated per request is alive for the whole wait and gets promoted rather
/// than collected cheaply. Reaching the same route through the Webservices module measured 2230
/// bytes a request against 1330 here - the module's binding and invocation being most of the
/// difference - and the remaining bytes are the engine's, not this handler's.
